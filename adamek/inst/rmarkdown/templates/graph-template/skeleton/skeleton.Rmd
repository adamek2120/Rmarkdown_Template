    initspeed (MPH) & initial speed of the pitch as it leaves the pitcher's hand \\
    breakx (in) & horizontal distance where a pitch crossed the plate in relation to a hypothetical spinless pitch \\
    breakz (in) & vertical distance where a pitch crossed the plate in relation to a hypothetical spinless pitch  \\
    initposx (ft) & horizontal position of the release point of the pitch \\
    initposz (ft) & vertical position of the release point of the pitch \\
    extension (ft) & distance in front of the pitching rubber the pitcher releases the ball \\
    spinrate (RPM) & how fast the ball is spinning as it leaves the pitcher's hand \\
    type & type of pitch that was thrown \\
